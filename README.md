A waypoint is set for the first NPC location.

Players interact with NPCs, choosing their approach:

Bribery: Reduces the chance of police alerts.

Threats: May alert the police!

Completion

After all NPC interactions, returning the vehicle ends the mission and resets progress.

Each NPC has a randomized reaction type:

Friendly: Engages in a normal handshake.

Neutral: Can be bribed to reduce police alert risk.

Aggressive: Might call the police if threatened!

NPCs select dialogue from a predefined list, adding variety to interactions.
